<h3>Building Process</h3>
<p style="color:palevioletred;font-family:Lucida Handwriting">Building a computer was similar to a glorified Lego set, with larger pieces, all of which could be installed a certain way, so it was easy to know if I made a mistake.</p>
<p style="color:steelblue;font-family:Lucida Console">The keyboard building process was a lot more tedious as there were more components as I made changes to each individual switch before installation. However, most of the pieces had to be aligned properly for a complete fit similar to building a computer.</p>
