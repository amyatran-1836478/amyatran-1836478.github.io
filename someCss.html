<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p style="color:lightsalmon">During quarantine, I took up new hobbies some of which were influenced by curiousity of hands-on projects.</p>
<p style="color:lightsalmon">These new hobbies incfluded building a computer and alongside a keyboard.</p>
<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<div class="container">
	<img src="computer.jpg" alt="Computer" style="width:50px;height=50px;margin:20px">
	<div class="centered">Computer</div>
</div>
<div class="container">
	<img src="keyboard.jpg" alt="Keyboard" style="width:50px;height=50px;margin:20px">
	<div class="centered">Keyboard</div>
</div>
<h3>Building Process</h3>
<p style="color:palevioletred;font-family:Lucida Handwriting">Building a computer was similar to a glorified Lego set, with larger pieces, all of which could be installed a certain way, so it was easy to know if I made a mistake.</p>
<p style="color:steelblue;font-family:Lucida Console">The keyboard building process was a lot more tedious as there were more components as I made changes to each individual switch before installation. However, most of the pieces had to be aligned properly for a complete fit similar to building a computer.</p>
